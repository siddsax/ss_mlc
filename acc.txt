Origin : Reached an acc. of 97 with 100 data pt per label on validation set, 
supervised had 91i [17ish 95, 36ish 96 115ish 97], batch size was 100.

Edit 1: Removed importance sampling, changed lr from 3e-4 and beta part removed. No change in acc.

Edit 1: Removed resampling of data and elbo. No evidence of decrease in acc. and doesnt seem it like doing anything.
